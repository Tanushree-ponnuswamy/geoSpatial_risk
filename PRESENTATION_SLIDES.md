# 📊 PROJECT PRESENTATION: Nilgiris Geo-Spatial Risk System

---

## 📅 SLIDE 1: Title Slide
# Geo-Spatial Risk–Based Building Approval System
### Specifically Designed for the Nilgiris District
**"Safety, Speed, and Sustainability"**

---

## 📅 SLIDE 2: The Core Problem
* **Fragile Ecosystem**: Nilgiris is prone to landslides and soil erosion.
* **Manual Approvals**: Current process is slow, subjective, and prone to error.
* **Risk Blindness**: Officers can't see "under the ground" (soil, slope stability) just by looking at plans.
* **Goal**: A system that **sees the risk** before construction starts.

---

## 📅 SLIDE 3: The Solution at a Glance
An **AI-Powered, GIS-Centric** platform that automates safety checks.
* **Step 1**: User draws land.
* **Step 2**: System checks GIS (Forest, Slope, Streams) instantly.
* **Step 3**: AI predicts Risk Score (0-100).
* **Step 4**: Authority focuses ONLY on high-risk cases.

## 📅 SLIDE 4: How it Works (The "Intelligence" Layer)
We don't just digitize paper; we add intelligence.
1. **Geometric Rules**: "Is the land inside a forest?" (Yes/No)
2. **Risk Scoring**: "Slope is 28° + Soil is loose = High Danger."
3. **Smart Heatmaps**: Visualizing danger zones for officers.

---

## 📅 SLIDE 5: Technology Stack
* **Frontend**: Responsive Web App (React/Vite).
* **Maps**: GIS Layers (OpenLayers / Leaflet).
* **Backend**: Python/Node.js with PostGIS.
* **AI engine**: Machine Learning for Risk, LLM for Explanations.

---

## 📅 SLIDE 6: Why is it Safe? (Governance)
* **No AI Hallucinations**: Laws are hard-coded rules, not AI guesses.
* **Human-in-the-Loop**: AI *advises* and *explains*, but the Officer *decides*.
* **Audit Trail**: Every risk score is traceable to specific data points.

---

## 📅 SLIDE 7: Expected Impact
* **90% Faster** initial screening.
* **Zero Permission** for illegal forest encroachments.
* **Science-based** decisions, not discretionary.
* **Citizen Trust**: Transparent rejection/approval reasons.

---

## 📅 SLIDE 8: Next Steps
1. **Prototype**: Build the frontend UI.
2. **GIS Integration**: Load Nilgiris sample layers.
3. **Pilot**: Test with 50 past cases.
